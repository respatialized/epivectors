* PSEUDOVECTORS

A pseudovector consists of three variables: position, orientation, magnitude. Together these form fundamentals of flexible, modular generative art. If all display methods reference these state variables, then they can seamlessly be switched on the fly.

The rest of this document contains an overview of what the project might contain based on initial notes.

* Concepts
+ Position
Two possible types: polar and cartesian
+ Orientation
Coordinate-based: polar/cartesian
Reference-based: absolute/relative
+ Magnitude
Linear, logarithmic, percentage

* Data structures
+ coord [float float]
+ shp [coord coord float]

* Functions
~(polar coord)~
~(cartesian coord)~
~(relative coord)~
Switch between coordinate types

~(polar func)~
~(relative func)~
Switch between types of drawing functions (higher order function)
